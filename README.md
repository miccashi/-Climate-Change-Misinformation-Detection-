# Climate-Change-Misinformation-Detection

Human-caused global warming is supported by ample scientific evidence. However, this point is still controversial, one reason for which is that some mainstream media spread misinformation about the reason resulting in climate change.  With the prevalence of the Internet, message generation and propagation have become extremely easy, and the detection of the nationality of information published by the media has become difficult. This causes some misleading content to be easily spread. For example, the cause of climate change has been scientifically proven to be mainly caused by human behavior, but there is still a lot of media disseminating some misinformation. Therefore, it is helpful if some systems that can automatically detect misinformation can be developed. 
This report concentrates on doing a binary classification among multiple news to detect whether a document contains misinformation about climate change. The Simple Baseline given for this task achieves 0.50 F1-Score, 0.34 Precision and 0.94 Recall.
